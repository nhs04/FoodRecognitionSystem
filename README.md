# Food Recognition System (Machine Learning Project) 

I worked on developing a machine learning model that classifies food items into specific categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). I preprocessed food images by resizing and normalizing them to ensure consistent input for the model. I evaluated the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure reliable performance across various food types.

What I Learned:

- I learned how to design and train a CNN model for image classification tasks.
- I developed skills in data preprocessing, including cleaning, resizing, and normalizing image datasets.
- I gained experience in evaluating machine learning models using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
